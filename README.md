          Netwave Admin Mapper
    ~Why didn't you change the password?~
A tool that searches Shodan for Netwave IP cameras with default admin passwords.  
You aren't going to use it for anything bad... right?

It runs on Python 3 and it requires a Shodan API key which you can get for free by creating an account at [Shodan's website](https://www.shodan.io/).

This is an improved version that includes a bug fix and introduces a retry mechanism in case of API failures.
